# AI Marketing Analytics Demo  

Hi, I’m Annalise! I’m a marketing strategist exploring how data and AI can make storytelling smarter and more human.  

This project analyzes synthetic customer data for independent restaurants to uncover insights that drive engagement and retention.  

### About the Data  
The dataset is a small, synthetic sample inspired by my MSc coursework at Bayes Business School. It includes customer demographics, engagement metrics, and loyalty patterns.  

### Methods Used  
• K-means clustering for segmentation  
• Regression and A/B testing for trend analysis  
• Data visualization for actionable insights  

### Why It Matters  
I’m fascinated by how marketers and developers can work together to translate data into clear, impactful decisions. Whether it’s optimizing a customer journey or designing go-to-market experiments, my goal is to connect with people more intelligently and authentically.
