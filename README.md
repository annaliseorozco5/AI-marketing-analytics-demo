# Marketing Analytics Demo  

Hi, I'm Annalise! I’m a marketing strategist exploring how data and technology can make storytelling more human and efficient.  

This small project explores how analytics can uncover insights that drive engagement and retention.  

### About the Data  
The dataset is a synthetic example inspired by my MSc coursework at Bayes Business School. It includes customer demographics, behavioral data, psychographic insights, and review-based sentiment for independent restaurants.  

### Methods Used  
- Segmentation (K-means clustering)  
- A/B testing and regression  
- Data visualization for actionable insights  

### Why It Matters  
I’m fascinated by how marketers and developers can work together to translate data into clear, impactful decisions. Whether it’s optimizing a customer journey or designing a go-to-market experiment, my goal is to connect with people more intelligently and authentically.
