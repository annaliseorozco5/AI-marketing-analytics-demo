# Marketing Analytics Demo

Hi, I'm Annalise!I am a marketing strategist exploring how data and technology can make storytelling more human and efficient.  
This small project explores how simple analytics can help uncover insights that drive engagement and retention.

### About the data
The dataset is a small, synthetic example inspired by my MSc coursework at Bayes Business School. It includes customer demographics, engagement metrics, and loyalty patterns.

### Methods used
- Segmentation (K-means clustering)  
- A/B testing and regression  
- Data visualization for actionable insights  

### Why it matters
I’m fascinated by how marketers and developers can work together to translate data into clear, impactful decisions.  
Whether it’s optimizing a customer journey or designing a go-to-market experiment, the goal is the same: to connect with people more intelligently and authentically.
